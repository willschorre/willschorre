<p> For the past year or so I've been mostly working on building a bunch of one synth I designed called the Double Knot. I'm also working on a few other projects, one is a keyboard-type device called the "keyed mosstone". I've also been doing some drawing and thinking about drawing, and I've been learning a bit about PIC assembly code, as the mighty mighty mosstone has a PIC16f1829 in it... wrote C code for what I will probably ship it with when new boards are done, and so its fun learning assembly. 4-3-18</p>
